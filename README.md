# NinjaFrog
 This is the first game development project I've done on my own.

All assets I got for free online from Unity Store and Itch.io.

This is tutorial for gameplay:

- Click to the screen to move Ninja Frog left or right.
- Avoid the weapons and collect as many fruits to get as many points as possible.
Please comment to help me edit, upgrade and add more ideas for further development. Thank you.
